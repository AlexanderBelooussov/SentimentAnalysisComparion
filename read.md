# NLP Python Coding Exercise
This coding exercise is designed to assess a young professional's Python knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The exercise consists of three NLP cases that the candidate should solve using pre-trained models and Python libraries. Solve the first problem only.

## Cases
### Solve this: 1. Classify text based on it being positive or negative
Given a dataset of customer reviews, build a script in Python that can classify each review as either positive or negative using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model. The script should output a CSV file with the review text and the corresponding sentiment score. Benchmark at least 2 models using the IMDB-movie-reviews dataset.
## Don't complete 2 and 3.
### 2. Extract sensitive data from a text
Given a set of text documents, build a Python script that can extract named entities such as people, organizations, and locations using a pre-trained named entity recognition model. The script should output a CSV file with the named entity text, the entity type, and the corresponding document ID.

### 3. Text Classification
Given a dataset of news articles, build a Python script that can classify each article into a specific category such as politics, sports, or entertainment using a pre-trained text classification model. The script should output a CSV file with the article text and the corresponding category label.

## Expectations
The candidate is expected to:

1. The development environment should be reproducible.
2. Write clean, readable, and maintainable code that follows best practices.
3. Be able to explain their code and their approach to solving the problem.
4. Benchmark reports on models used.
4. Use version control to manage their code and explain their workflow.
5. Demo the code (script, endpoint, streamlit, gradio, ...)
6. Optionally, write a predict endpoint for an API using a framework of their choice, such as Flask or FastAPI, and explain their choice of framework.

## Deliverables
In the end, there should be:

1. A github repository
2. Clean, well documented code
3. A readme file
4. Presentation that explains workflow
5. A demo

These tasks were designed to be solved within 2 hours using pre-trained models and Python libraries. Additionally, they should be able to write a basic API endpoint that takes in a text input and returns the predicted sentiment, named entities, or category label using the script they developed.

Good luck with the exercise!
